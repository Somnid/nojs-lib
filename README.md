# No JS Lib

https://ndesmic.github.com/nojs-lib/

Collection of components that don't use JS.  HTML and CSS only.  

`global.css` is used for a baseline style reset only, it is not required for functionality.

## Why?

Javascript is taxing, it has to be downloaded, parsed and executed before elements can become interactive.  What if instead we concentrated harder on HTML and CSS to get that interactivity faster?  How many common controls would work like that?

## No JS doesn't mean never JS

It's also not necessary that we are completely at the mercy of CSS.  We can always progressively enhance the elements with javascript after the fact to get functionality that was maybe not needed but makes the experience better.
