			<h1>Semantics</h1>
			<p>All NoJS components use custom-element naming conventions <code>nojs-{componentName}</code>.  This is because they are designed to be ready to upgraded and extended into real custom elements! By convention, all nested items must be referred to by a class.  This is to prevent leaking styles down to other elements.  The style is `{componentName}-{subComponent}` so, for example, a <code>nojs-tab</code> panel would be class <code>tab-panel</code>.  Hidden checkboxes and radios are referred to as <code>{componentName}-flag</code> because they represent the 1-bit state of the component as least in my convention.</p>

			<h1>Notes and Limitations</h1>
			<p>Since we are utilizing custom element syntax and this is a prerender strategy, we need to be careful to not include rules like <code>*:not(:defined)</code> so the elements will appear correctly.  If this rule is desired then you'll need to make sure you override it per element.</p>
